  django-admin startproject carhub
```
- Open the carhub folder in vs code. The folder should contain a carhub folder and a manage.py file.

  python manage.py startapp home
```
- Also create the templates folder and the static folder for your templates and static files and you are good to go.
- Create a folder by the name of data analysis to add the dataset and the data analysis file to run the code.
- It would be a good practice to first do the analysis part on a notebook like google colab etc.
